•           Be respectful of the personal boundaries of other participants

•           Be respectful of differing perspectives and experiences

•           Look out for each other, and to alert the conference organisers should any offending action be witnessed

<b>Unacceptable Behaviour</b>

Offending actions include, but are not limited to:

•           Invasion of privacy, including the taking of screenshots and recordings of people, events, or conversations without express permission; and the posting of personal details of other participants without their consent

•           Harassment, including persistent and unwelcome solicitation of intimacy; deliberate intimidation or cyberstalking; and the sustained use of professionally inappropriate comments
