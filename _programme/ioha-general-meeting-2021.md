<b>Dr. Nompilo Ndlovu *(Africa)*</b> is an oral historian whose PhD focused on the memory and justice initiatives associated with the Gukurahundi violent atrocities in post-colonial Zimbabwe. She studied in the Department of Historical Studies at the University of Cape Town – during which time, she worked as an adjunct lecturer. Further, Ndlovu fulfilled a two-year tenure as a Postdoctoral Fellow for the Mellon funded History Access programme in the aforementioned Department and University. In this time, she developed her research focus to include ‘languaging’ the past where she explores the nexus between orality, language (i.e. vernacularity, multilingualism, lexicon) and memory/history. A further extension to this research focus is around counter histories in public life, where legacies of violence are unofficially addressed through public performance and local transitional justice initiatives. Prior to this, she studied and worked as a practitioner within the disciplines of Gender and Development amongst various communities within South Africa, and in other geographies on the African continent. Dr. Ndlovu recently served at the UNAMID peacekeeping mission in Darfur, Sudan within the Policy and Best Practices unit.
