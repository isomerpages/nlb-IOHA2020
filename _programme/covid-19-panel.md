<b> COVID-19 as a Catalyst for Change: Rethinking Concepts of Memory and Oral History </b>

Our lives and communities have changed in fundamental ways due to the effects of COVID-19. Oral historians are working in creative and innovative ways across the globe to document the pandemic through rapid-response collecting initiatives. This panel will consider the deeper implications of COVID-19 for oral history and the extent to which it has been a catalyst for change for the discipline. We will take particular notice of the ways in which the imperative to capture the crisis as it continues to unfold is reframing our concepts of memory and oral history. 

Questions to be considered will include:

•	How are we engaging with shifting temporal experiences and the notion of historical consciousness?

•	How can oral history be used with social purpose and what are the responsibilities of practitioners in pandemic times? 

•	What is unique about oral history’s contribution to documenting and remembering the pandemic?
