<p><strong>Synopsis of Workshop</strong></p>
<p>Presenters from the Oral History Association’s Metadata Task Force will paint a picture of oral history practice in the United States by sharing results gathered during focus group sessions and online surveys over the past few years. They will also debut, at the international level, a comprehensive “What’s Important to Know” set of metadata elements, followed by a facilitated discussion with workshop participants. The primary aim: to assess the universal utility of these (North American) metadata elements as critical to creating, preserving and making oral histories accessible to researchers. This is an opportunity for peer learning; discovering contrasts and similarities in oral history practices across cultural contexts. 
	
Presenters will also share a demo of their interactive online tool, currently in development, designed to assist practitioners in metadata decision-making, and how to map oral history metadata to various standards. Lastly, participants will engage in a hands-on exercise with the online tool to begin thinking about their own metadata practices. Group work will centre on the question of improving metadata practices to make oral history collections more accessible and easier to administer in the future. This workshop offers a holistic way of thinking about metadata that moves away from technical lingo and toward a shared understanding of what is useful to know about oral histories! Note: No technical expertise required for participation. </p>
