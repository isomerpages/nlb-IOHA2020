In accordance with the World Health Organization declaring the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, and in view of the Ministry of Health, Singapore’s recommendations for social-distancing measures, the IOHA Conference Organising Team, with the support of the IOHA Council, have decided to postpone the IOHA Conference in Singapore, originally scheduled to be held on 22–26 June. We will announce revised dates once these can be confirmed. We wish good health and safety to everyone in the international oral history community and we look forward to inviting you again to Singapore under more favourable conditions. *-IOHA Conference 2020 Organising Team*
