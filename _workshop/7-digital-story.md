<p><strong>Synopsis of Workshop</strong></p>
<p>This digital storytelling workshop emphasises developing stories based on oral methods, and putting the stories together in a digital form.</p>
<p>Digital storytelling is a way to reflect on experiences and share life stories, and is suitable for both personal uses and when dealing with narratives in professional contexts, as a teaser for long-form articles and stories. This workshop will focus on the characteristics of a digital story through the development of a story and a storyboard. The method has been successfully used in Norway to convey historical stories, as cultural heritage institutions have developed stories from elements in their collections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants will learn:</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scriptwriting, the revision process, storyboarding and the production process</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using images, narration, music and motion to tell a story</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to explore an idea with technology</p>
